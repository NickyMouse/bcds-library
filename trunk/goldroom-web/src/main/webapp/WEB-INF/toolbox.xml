	<!--
		application scoped tools will be instantiated only once and then
		reused for each request. Due to this, it is strongly encouraged that
		your application scoped tools be completely threadsafe. The MathTool
		in the GenericTools section is a good example of tool meant to be
		application scoped. If an application scoped tool implements ViewTool,
		then the javax.servlet.ServletContext for the webapp will be passed to
		its init(Object) method after it is instantiated. session scoped tools
		are instantiated once per unique session and are then reused for every
		request associated with that particular session. If a session scoped
		tool implements ViewTool, then its init(Object) method will be passed
		the ViewContext of the request during which the session was created.
		request is the default scope. If no scope is specified for a <tool> in
		your toolbox.xml, then it will be automatically set as request scope.
		Tools with this scope are instantiated for every servlet request fed
		to the VelocityViewServlet. If a request scoped tool implements
		ViewTool, then its init(Object) method will be passed the current
		ViewContext.
